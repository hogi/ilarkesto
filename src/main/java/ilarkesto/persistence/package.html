Framework for creating persistent objects (entities).

<h3>Entities &amp; Data Access Objects</h3>

<p>Every entity has a unique UUID (id).
For every entity type there is a Data Access Object (DAO), named by the entity.
While an entity represents the data, the DAO provides access to the entities.
It contains a delete-, a save- and all available query-methods.</p>


<h3>Transactions</h3>

<p>When calling the delete- or the save-method for an entity on its DAO, the action is not performed instantly.
Instead it is placed in the current transaction.
The commit-method on the transaction needs to be called, to perform all save and delete actions to all entities
involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>When changing properties of an entity, this entity is automatically placed in the current transaction.
Calling the save-method on the DAO is only required when a new entity is created.</p>


<h3>Data Store</h3>

<p>Entities are saved as files. Each entity type gets its own folder.
In this folder every entity is saved in its own file. The file is named by the entities id.</p>


<h3>Backups</h3>

<p>Every time an entity is modified or deleted, a backup copy of the old entity-file is created.
A backup can by prevented for an entity type by implementing the <code>BackupHostile</code>-interface.</p>
